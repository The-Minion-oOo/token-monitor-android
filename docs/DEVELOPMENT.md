# Development guide

Read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing runtime behavior and
[Hub protocol compatibility](PROTOCOL.md) before changing network models.

## Toolchain

| Requirement | Version |
| --- | --- |
| JDK | 17 or newer |
| Android SDK | Platform 37 and current build tools |
| Gradle | Wrapper included in the repository |
| Node.js | 22 or newer, only for the fixture Hub |
| Emulator | API 36 Google APIs image recommended |

`local.properties` must point to the Android SDK and is ignored by Git.

## Common commands

Run these from the repository root. Use `./gradlew` instead of
`.\gradlew.bat` on macOS or Linux.

```powershell
# Unit tests, lint, and debug APK
.\gradlew.bat :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :app:assembleDebug

# Emulator interaction suite
.\gradlew.bat :app:connectedDebugAndroidTest -PtokenMonitorPreview=true

# One JVM test class
.\gradlew.bat :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*HubDiscoveryTest*"
```

Debug output is written to `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Lint reports are in
`app/build/reports/`.

## Preview package

Debug and release APKs use different signing keys. Build the isolated preview
package when a release is already installed:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PtokenMonitorPreview=true
```

It installs as `io.github.theminionooo.tokenmonitor.preview` and has separate
pairing and preferences. Never use the preview flag for a release.

## Fixture Hub

The local fixture serves sanitized v0.61.0 responses on port 17321 with the
secret `fixture-secret`:

```powershell
node tools/fixture-hub.mjs
```

An Android emulator reaches the host at `http://10.0.2.2:17321`. Enable the
private Wi-Fi option in the app for this address.

### Showcase captures

README images use a richer made-up dataset:

```powershell
$env:TOKEN_MONITOR_SHOWCASE = "1"
$env:TOKEN_MONITOR_FIXTURE_PORT = "17322"
node tools/fixture-hub.mjs
```

Pair the preview app with `http://10.0.2.2:17322` and secret `showcase`. Capture
the rendered app or widget; do not assemble screens from design mockups. The
source dataset is `tools/showcase-data.mjs` and the image compositor is
`tools/build-showcase.mjs`. Unset both environment variables afterwards.

For the Pages widget, capture Overview, Limits, Breakdown, and Activity at the
same launcher allocation. Keep all four production renders together in README
marketing so typography, card geometry, navigation controls, and empty-space
handling can be compared directly.

Never put a real Hub secret, address, account, device, project, or usage response
in a fixture or screenshot.

## Tests

JVM tests cover protocol parsing, private-address rules, endpoint failover,
stream recovery, ordered cache writes, history aggregation, presentation rules,
and preferences. Versioned Hub fixtures live under
`app/src/test/resources/protocol/`. The v0.61.0 set covers all five read
endpoints, full stream frames, a freshness-only frame, canonical MiMo and Devin
clients, Cline and Devin limits, tri-state session activity, context-window
values, and current percentage and credit limit shapes.

Instrumentation tests use the preview package to exercise navigation, dialogs,
widgets, storage, and lifecycle behavior. Run them on an API 36 emulator before
handing off a meaningful UI or lifecycle change. Visual changes also need a
native screenshot at the affected phone or launcher size.

Current coverage and physical-device limits are recorded in
[Validation](VALIDATION.md).

## Engineering rules

- Keep the app read-only. Network code calls only the documented Hub GET routes.
- Validate every saved address before sending the bearer secret. Reject redirects.
- Keep secrets out of UI state, logs, fixtures, screenshots, and issue reports.
- Share one repository between the visible dashboard and an explicit widget
  session. Stop it when neither owner needs data.
- Queue cache writes and finish the last save or clear before repository shutdown.
- Treat unknown Hub fields as compatible; add a new fixture directory when the
  verified desktop protocol changes.
- Use `LocalPalette`, shared formatting helpers, and `LocalNow` rather than
  creating parallel presentation rules in a screen.
- Keep motion interaction-driven and honor reduced-motion settings.
- Add dependencies only when the platform or existing libraries cannot provide
  the behavior cleanly.

## Adding features

### Hub fields

Add the field to the tolerant DTO, map it once in `HubProtocolParser`, expose it
through the domain model, add it to the appropriate versioned fixture, and test
the mapping before using it in UI.

### Stream events

Keep delivery semantics in `HubStreamProtocol`. A complete event may pass through
the stable snapshot parser; an incremental event must explicitly whitelist the
fields it can replace and preserve the rest of the last complete snapshot. Add a
fixture and reducer test before wiring the event into `HubRepository`.

### Presentation semantics

Put reusable rules such as session activity windows, context percentages, and
vendor families in small presentation helpers. Test those helpers independently;
screens should render the result rather than re-interpret protocol fields.

### Dashboard views

Add the destination, icon, `DashboardContent` route, and default display option.
Keep screen-specific state in the screen or ViewModel and shared formatting in
the existing presentation helpers.

### Tools and model vendors

Extend `vendorOf`, `originalToolColor`, and `upstreamToolAsset` where an upstream
mark exists. Marks are monochrome vector resources named `upstream_logo_*`.

### Display settings

Add a default to `DisplayOptions`, persistence in `DisplayPreferences`, a
ViewModel pass-through, and the control and collapsed summary in Settings.

## Continuous integration

- **Android checks:** JVM tests, lint, and debug assembly on pull requests and
  pushes to `main`.
- **Android interaction checks:** API 36 emulator suite on app pull requests and
  app changes merged to `main`.
- **Upstream release check:** weekly comparison with the desktop release in
  `upstream.json`; it opens an issue and never merges changes automatically.
- **Dependabot:** weekly Gradle and GitHub Actions updates.

Release signing and publishing are documented in [Releasing](RELEASING.md).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` | Use the separate preview package; debug and release keys differ. |
| Emulator cannot reach the fixture | Use `10.0.2.2`, not `127.0.0.1`. |
| Gradle cannot find the SDK | Create `local.properties` with `sdk.dir=<Android SDK path>`. |
| Find on Wi-Fi is slow in the emulator | The simulated network can take several seconds. |
| A desktop address starts with `169.254` | Use the `100.x` address shown by Tailscale instead. |

Android permits only one active UiAutomation connection. Stop interactive CLI
inspection before running instrumentation tests.
