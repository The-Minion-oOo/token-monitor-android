# Changelog

Android releases use the desktop protocol version plus an Android revision.
Unreleased work stays under **Next release** until its signed APK is published.

## v0.66.0 r2 — 2026-10-04

- Request Android 17 local-network access when connecting or searching over
  home Wi-Fi, with recovery after denial and Tailscale available independently.
- Test and save a changed home address using the stored pairing secret. A
  discovered address is not saved until that check succeeds.
- Enforce the widget Live deadline across device sleep and between requests;
  show reconnecting and saved-data age in its notification.
- Preserve unattributed usage and missing calendar days in Trends. Search
  visible session titles, identifiers and tool names, with clearer empty states.
- Add selected-control and chart semantics, page-specific widget summaries,
  and consistent quota urgency across Home and Limits.
- Avoid decoding the complete stats response twice on live updates while
  retaining previously received device history.
- Add a contract check against pinned released Hub source, synthetic performance
  baselines, Android 17 coverage, and exact-commit release checks.

The desktop baseline stays v0.66.0. Widget geometry and the existing release
signing identity are retained.

## v0.66.0 r1 — 2026-10-04

- Follow desktop v0.66.0 with synthetic fixtures for every Hub read endpoint,
  complete/freshness stream events and retained earlier compatibility tests.
- Recognize MiniMax Code as `mcode`, using its display label and MiniMax mark
  across the existing app and widget surfaces, separate from MiniMax limits.
- Preserve desktop-supplied costs in current usage and history, including
  custom-pricing corrections; no Android-side pricing or collection is added.
- Keep the widget geometry, private read-only connection, bounded Live behavior
  and release signing identity unchanged.

## v0.65.0 r1 — 2026-10-02

- Follow desktop v0.65.0 with versioned fixtures for every Hub read endpoint and
  complete/freshness stream events; retain earlier protocol regressions.
- Add fx's lowercase label and upstream mark.
- Show session-average generation speed, cache-hit percentage and optional
  prompt-cache estimates in Home and Sessions when reported.
- Add a local **Show session titles** setting. Hiding titles changes display
  only; the snapshot cache may still contain them.
- Keep the Pages widget layout, private read-only connection, release signing
  identity and bounded Live behavior unchanged.

## v0.64.0 r1 — 2026-09-30

- Match the released desktop v0.64.0 Hub with new synthetic endpoint and stream
  fixtures, retaining earlier compatibility tests.
- Add Muse Code's label and mark and read StepFun's optional plan name alongside
  its Coding and Token Plan windows.
- Add recent/running sessions to Home, with reported titles and recent context.
  New installs show Sessions by default; existing saved Home layouts stay intact.
- Keep archived/deleted sessions idle. Preserve Grok Build titles, Codex plan
  labels, and OpenRouter's normalized resetting allowance.
- Keep session rows distinct when different tools report the same session ID.
- Leave the Pages widget geometry, signing identity, private read-only Hub access,
  and bounded Live behavior unchanged.

## v0.63.1 r1 — 2026-09-28

- Verify the desktop v0.63.1 Hub contract with sanitized fixtures for all five
  read endpoints, a complete stream event, and a freshness update.
- Preserve Cursor's canonical `cursor-auto` model across totals, sessions, and
  history, plus the reasoning-inclusive ZCode and OpenCode counters reported by
  the desktop. No Android-side usage collection or widget layout change.
- Keep daily output and cache totals when a matching sparse history preview
  follows the full Hub history response; changed days cannot reuse stale totals.

## v0.63.0 r1 — 2026-09-27

- Verify the desktop v0.63.0 Hub read contract with sanitized examples for all
  five endpoints, complete stream delivery, and freshness-only updates.
- Show a reported Cursor conversation title in Sessions while retaining the
  client/model fallback for older or untitled sessions. No transcript bodies are
  requested or synchronized by the Android app.
- Keep the four-page widget layout and background-work behavior unchanged.

## v0.62.0 r1 — 2026-09-24

- Add an on-demand update check in Settings for published Android releases.
- Verify a downloaded APK's size, SHA-256, package, version, and signing
  certificate before handing it to Android's installer for user confirmation.
- Include a machine-readable update manifest in future release assets.
- Verify the v0.62.0 Hub contract with a new sanitized fixture for all read
  endpoints and stream events. Keep Pi and Oh My Pi usage distinct, show
  TypeSafe's plan and balance, and retain Devin's reported plan.

## v0.61.0 r1 — 2026-09-23

- Verify every Android read endpoint against desktop Token Monitor v0.61.0 and
  add a sanitized full-endpoint fixture while retaining the v0.54.0 through
  v0.60.0 compatibility cases.
- Recognize the canonical Xiaomi MiMo and Devin clients, the Cline and Devin
  limit providers, GitHub Copilot, and the desktop's current provider names.
- Add the upstream Cline and Devin marks and keep older MiMo client IDs readable
  after the desktop's normalization to `mimo`.
- Preserve the r7 Pages widget geometry and type scale; this compatibility
  release changes data identity and presentation only.

## v0.60.0 r7 — 2026-09-22

- Give both dense Breakdown columns one two-line row with room between the
  lines: name and share, then tokens and cost, then the bar. Rows line up
  across the divider and nothing touches its neighbour.
- Center the app icon, the Limits provider marks and the Breakdown vendor
  marks on the text lines beside them instead of on the first line alone.
- Show today's cost in the Activity stat slot when the Hub reports no message
  count for the day, instead of a false "0 messages".
- Give the common one-tool/one-model Breakdown state a dedicated feature
  layout with large, aligned token and share figures, explicit captions, and
  full-width bars. Dense multi-row data keeps the compact table layout.

- Verify the desktop Token Monitor v0.60.0 Hub contract while retaining the
  v0.54.0, v0.55.0, and v0.56.0 compatibility fixtures.
- Negotiate stream protocol v2 and merge lightweight freshness events into the
  last complete snapshot without dropping periods, limits, devices, or history.
- Show a session as Running, Finished, or Idle from the new tri-state turn signal,
  and show recent context-window use when both token values are available.
- Recognize the current Factory credit/allowance limit shapes and add Qwen,
  NVIDIA, and StepFun provider presentation without changing the read-only boundary.
- Rebuild the four widget pages on one measured grid written down in
  `docs/WIDGET_SPEC.md`. Every position and type size now comes from that
  specification, the card scales as one picture to any launcher size, and the
  Overview stats, Limits cells, Breakdown rows and Activity charts match the
  approved concept cards instead of colliding.
- Bundle a Latin subset of JetBrains Mono for the widget pages so Samsung
  launchers, which substitute their own monospace face, render the same card
  the emulator does. Figures keep the system sans-serif with tabular numerals.
- Group the Limits page by provider, each with its two tightest windows, and
  draw bars, the seven-day chart and the heatmap as vectors on the card instead
  of scaled bitmaps.
- Render the card at the launcher's display density instead of enlarging a
  560-pixel raster. Type, icons, borders, and charts stay sharp on high-density
  Samsung launchers while remaining inside Android's widget bitmap budget.
- Fix eleven imported vendor logos whose SVG arc flags Android's path parser
  rejects. Drawing a Qwen, Gemini, Meta, Cohere, Kimi, MiniMax, Doubao, Hunyuan,
  OpenRouter, xAI or Xiaomi mark in the widget crashed the render.
- Render the widget gallery and the widget design test from the dense showcase
  fixture rather than a two-row protocol sample, so emulator evidence shows the
  card at real density.
- Split stream delivery and session display rules into focused modules so future
  desktop upgrades remain fixture-and-adapter work instead of screen rewrites.

## v0.56.0 — September 13, 2026

### r4

- Verify protocol compatibility with desktop Token Monitor v0.56.0, including
  typed reset/expiry boundaries and background-review session metadata. Older
  v0.54.0 and v0.55.0 Hub responses remain supported.
- Add a separate medium/large pages widget with Overview, Limits, Breakdown,
  and Activity backed by one cached snapshot. The launcher receives one fixed
  1.82:1 card instead of a collection, preventing One UI from shrinking and
  fanning the pages.
- Add accessible left and right edge controls plus four page dots. Changing a
  page is local and adds no timer, network request, or background work.
- Use one shared typography scale across all four pages. Only the headline token
  total is intentionally larger; long provider and model names truncate instead
  of forcing smaller text.
- Replace the generic deck picker art with a fixed, populated preview that uses
  the same wide proportions and information hierarchy as the installed widget.
- Replace the widget refresh text glyph with a vector icon in a transparent
  48 dp touch target while retaining the existing five responsive widget sizes.
- Keep immediate streaming while the dashboard is open, and use a lighter
  30-second stats refresh during an explicit widget Live session.
- Repost the Live notification only when its visible content changes.
- Finish queued snapshot saves and cache clears before repository shutdown.

## v0.54.0 — September 8, 2026

### r20

- Use the overview widget layout at Samsung's common 4×2 height, with responsive
  tool and limit detail as space permits.

### r19

- Show current usage and the tightest provider windows in the Live notification.
- Request Android 16 notification promotion and declare lock-screen widget
  eligibility where the launcher supports it.

### r18

- Replace the widget button row with compact Refresh and Live controls.
- Add responsive message, active-time, streak, tool-share, quota-window, and
  seven-day details using data already present in the saved snapshot.

### r17

- Label the active Tailscale, home Wi-Fi, or private-network route.
- Add a setting that follows the phone's light and dark mode.
- Distinguish same-named limit windows by their period on Home, Limits, and widgets.

### r14

- Reduce the visual weight of widget controls while preserving 48 dp touch targets.
- Correct README hero and gallery alignment.

### r13

- Redesign all widget sizes with dashboard typography, sharp size-aware charts,
  responsive spacing, full counters, Refresh, and bounded one-hour Live mode.
- Add tool-filtered model pages, heatmap day details, usage search, completed-period
  comparisons, and denser dashboard lists.
- Improve stream cancellation, snapshot recovery, retained device history, and
  shared repository ownership between the dashboard and widget service.
- Split the Compose interface into focused screen and shared-component files.

## v0.54.0 — September 7, 2026

### r5

- Open activity-heatmap days to show their date, tokens, and cost.

### r4

- Add interface themes, desktop theme codes, live indicators, and tool-icon
  preferences.

### r3

- Make Settings sections expand one at a time.
